# AloftCustomIslands

A very very small mod to load custom islands created in the island editor from their .json file.
This mod is tested on the Pre-Alpha 0.1.25 demo version of the game.

# How to use this mod?

use it at your own risk. You need to install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (version 5.x) in order to load this mod, see their guides for more information.

# Where is the json data loaded from?

see at the source code, its a hardcoded path atm and only one custom island can be spawned one time by hitting the L key ingame.
i may come back to make this more user friendly but as the game will most likely change a lot in the future i may aswell just wait to see what comes.

im pretty sure this will get implemented in the base game anyways sooner or later.
